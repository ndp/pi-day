## FAQ

### Isn't March 14th π day already?

March 14th was declared by U.S.-centric Berkeley hippies. According to Wikipedia, it's never been voted on by the pope, God or any of the living human royalty.

### Doesn't everybody just think of "π" when they hear March 14th? 

Not really. To most of the world, March 14th would be written as 14.03.2022, or just 14/3. In the U.S., the day and month are backwards, so only there is it written 3/14. But if you're a human being, you've likely never seen "/" used to respresent a decimal. No, Americans generally don't use periods to separate the day and the month, so that part is a stretch too.  Honestly, Americans write 3/14, which is 0.214285714... last I checked.

### Isn't 3.14 really close?

3.14 is a poor, grade-school approximation of π. It's off by 0.0015926535897932384626... This is an error of 0.05069573829%, so at first blush it seems pretty good. 

But 22/7 is off from π by only 0.00126448926735, which is 0.0402499434771%. Last I checked, 0.04 is less than 0.05.

### Isn't 3.14 just easier to deal with?
Not really. Unless your circle has a diameter of 10 or something like that, you're got some 3-digit multiplication in your future. With the nice fraction 22/7, you can often "cancel out" something and get to your answer faster. (Same goes for the metric system, but that's a different problem.)
