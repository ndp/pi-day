# π ≈ 22/7

## Also know as "International Practically Pi  Day"

## How do I to celebrate?
- make (and eat) a pie (Pi). Yes, pizza is a pie.
- recite all the digits of π that you're memorized to the "amazement" of your "friends."
- calculate pi in some unique way
- get together with some nerdy friends and nerd out in some other way
- do you homework

## Wait, isn't March 14th π day?

March 14th was declared π Day by U.S.-centric San Francisco hippies very recently. This follows on
in the tradition of the [Indian Pi Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill), when some misguided
lawmakers thought they could legislate the value of π. 
[Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) and the Egyptians talked about 22/7 [thousands of years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80), and it's stood the test of time. Let's celebrate!

## Doesn't everybody in the world automatically think of "π" when they hear March 14th? 

To most of the world, March 14th would be written as `14.03.2022`, or just `14/3`. Neither
of these seems to have much to do with π. 

In the U.S., the day and month are written backwards, so there is it written 3/14. But if you're a human being, you've likely never seen "/" used to respresent a decimal. Americans generally don't use periods to separate the day and the month.  Honestly, Americans almost always write 3/14, which is 0.214285714... last I checked. What a mess.

| How to write March 14  |  Who does this? |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 14.03          |  People on StarTrek who use stardates?  |
| 14/3           |  Everyone in the world (except U.S.)    | 
| 3/14           |  U.S. standard                          | 
| 3.14           |  Pretty much *NOBODY*                     | 


### Isn't 3.14 really close?

Not really.

| Approximation  |  Error               | Error %        |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 3.14           |  0.00159265358979... | 0.05069573829% |
| 22/7           |  0.00126448926735... | **0.04024994348%** | 


## Isn't 3.14 just easier to deal with?

Nope. 3.14 suffers the same problems as the metric system. Unless your circle has a diameter of 10 (or something similar), you're got some 3-digit multiplication or division in your future. 

With the nice fraction 22/7, you can often "cancel out" and get to your answer faster.
